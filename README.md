# NEURA – A Therapeutical & Logical Chatbot 🤖💙🧠

NEURA is an AI-powered chatbot that intelligently classifies user queries into two categories:  
- **Therapeutical (Emotional Support)** – responds with empathy, compassion, and guidance.  
- **Logical (Fact-based Response)** – provides clear, concise, and evidence-driven answers.  

This balance allows NEURA to serve as both a **therapist** and a **logical assistant**, depending on user needs.
