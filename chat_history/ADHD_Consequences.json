Its manifestation varies, but symptoms typically begin in childhood and can persist into adulthood.\n\nThe core symptoms are:\n*   **Inattention:** Difficulty sustaining focus, being easily distracted, problems with organization, forgetfulness in daily activities, and failure to follow through on instructions.\n*   **Hyperactivity:** Fidgeting, restlessness, difficulty engaging in quiet activities, excessive talking.\n*   **Impulsivity:** Hasty actions that occur in the moment without forethought, difficulty waiting for one's turn, interrupting others.\n\n**Consequences of untreated or poorly managed ADHD can include:**\n\n1.  **Academic and Occupational Difficulties:** Lower academic achievement, increased rates of school dropout, challenges with job performance, frequent job changes, and higher unemployment rates.\n2.  **Social and Interpersonal Problems:** Difficulties forming and maintaining relationships, increased conflict with peers and family members, and social isolation.\n3.  **Emotional and Psychological Impact:** Lower self-esteem, increased risk of anxiety disorders, depression, and substance use disorders.
