It's something so many of us grapple with.\n\nWhen you ask about improving one's mental state, what does that feel like for you right now? Are there particular emotions or experiences that come to mind when you think about your current mental state, or when you imagine a better one?\n\nSometimes, just acknowledging the desire for change is a huge first step. I wonder, what sparked this question for you at this particular moment? And what does \"improving your mental state\" look or feel like in your own heart and mind?"
